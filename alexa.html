    <div class="parag"><p>With more than 20,000 skills and counting, Alexa is always getting smarter. Skills are like apps and help you do more such as planning your commute with NextThere or watching the latest episode of 7 Sunrise. Just say, “Alexa, show me skills” to get started. New skills are being added all the time. Discover them in the skill and games section of the Alexa app or visit the Skill Store.</p>
